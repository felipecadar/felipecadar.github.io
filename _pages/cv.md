#### Graduating and Researcher

I am a graduate student in computer science at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I have been doing scientific
initiation at the Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics (VeRLab) since I joined the course in the first semester of 2016.
I really enjoy doing scientific research and would love to see my work to have a positive impact on someoneâ€™s life.
