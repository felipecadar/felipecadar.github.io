#### Graduating and Researcher

I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. I have been doing scientific research at the Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics (VeRLab) since I joined the CS undergrad program in the first semester of 2016. I have participated in publications in major venues like CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, and CVIU. I have worked on many projects, like extracting local features for nonrigid surfaces at VeRLab, multimodal and memory-augmented models at the Google Research Internship, and robotics and virtual reality at Vale Institute of Technology. I really enjoy doing research and would love to see my work positively impact someone's life.
