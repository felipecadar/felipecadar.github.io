#### Graduating and Researcher

I am a graduate student in computer science at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I have been doing scientific
initiation at the Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics (VeRLab) since I joined the course in the first semester of 2016.
I really enjoy doing scientific research and would love to see my work to have a positive impact on someone’s life.

# EXPERIENCE

#### Scientific research

**VeRLab - Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics**
April 2016–Today,  UFMG, BeloHorizonte, MinasGerais

* Comprehensive Knowledge in ComputerVision

* Good video editing skills

# PROJECTS

#### Semantic Hyperlapse

**VeRLab - Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics**

April 2016 – September 2018, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, MinasGerais

In this project, I was part of a team developing a semantic fast-forward method for first-person videos. Our goal was to
accelerate extremely long and unstable first-person videos to emphasize important parts while maintaining smooth motion.
We also proposed an 80-hour Dataset of Multimodal Semantic Egocentric Videos (DoMSEV)
More info in https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/semantic-hyperlapse/

Keywords: Semantic Hyperlapse, Sparse Coding, Convolutional Neural Networks, RGB-D Dataset.

#### Advanced Teleoperation of Mining Equipment: Excavator

**VeRLab/ITV-Intituto Tecnológico Vale/UFMG**

November 2017 – Today , UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais

The main objective of this project is to investigate the problem of the remote operation of mining equipment and propose a
system aiming to increase safety and productivity. We also develop a mobile platform to simulate the teleoperation of an
excavator using our proposed system using virtual reality and haptic feedback to provide a greater immersion for the
operator.

Keywords: Teleoperation, Mobile Platform, Virtual Reality, Haptic Feedback

#### Binary Descriptor Invariant to Non-Rigid Deformations for RGB-D Images

**VeRLab - Laboratory of Computer Vision and Robotics**

June 2018 – March 2019, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais

The project aims to develop a binary RGB-D descriptor invariant to isometric deformations, such as tissue deformations.

Keywords: RGB-D Images, Binary Descriptor
