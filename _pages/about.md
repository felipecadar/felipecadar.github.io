I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I have been doing scientific research at the Laboratory [VeRLab Computer Vision and Robotics](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/) since I joined the CS Graduation in the first semester of 2016. I really enjoy doing research and would love to see my work positively impact someone's life.
