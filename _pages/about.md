I am a graduation student in Computer Science at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG - Brazil). In 2016 I joined the [VeRLab Computer Vision and Robotics](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/) team in the [Semantic Hyperlapse project](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/semantic-hyperlapse/). Today work in the [Advanced Teleoperation](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/advanced-teleoperation-of-mining-equipment-bulldozer/) project focused in investigate the problem of the remote operation of mining equipment and propose a system aiming to increase safety and productivity.
